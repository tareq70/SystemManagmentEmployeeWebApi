Employee Management System API

The Employee Management System API is a backend solution built with ASP.NET Core Web API to streamline organizational operations related to employees, departments, attendance, payroll, and reporting.
It follows Clean Architecture principles for scalability and maintainability, implementing Repository and Unit of Work patterns for clean data access.
Data communication between layers is handled using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), ensuring clean request and response models.
Authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT Tokens with role-based access control for Admin, Manager, and Employee roles.

Would you like me to include example API routes (like /api/employees, /api/departments, etc.) and sample request/response JSON for each module?
That would make the README more developer-friendly for others using
